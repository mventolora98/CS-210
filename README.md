# CS-210

Overview
This project was developed as part of the CS 210 course at Southern New Hampshire University. It focuses on [briefly describe your project, such as financial tracking, data processing, etc.]. The main objective is to complete assignments 100% if possible  

By implementing this project, I applied key programming principles in C++, improved problem-solving skills, and enhanced my ability to write clean and efficient code.

Problem Statement
The project addresses how it relates to real life situation coding. Before this implementation, trying to write the proper code to have it excepted you could miss a syntax and it throws off the code and you have to try to figure out what is missing.

Features
- [Feature 1: e.g., user authentication, data analysis, real-time processing]
- [Feature 2: e.g., error handling, file I/O, multi-threading]
- [Feature 3: e.g., secure input validation, optimized algorithms]
  
Reflection on the Project

What problem was this project solving?
This project aimed to make a time clock add time subtract. The implementation allows users to to able to know a future time or what time has passed. 

What did I do particularly well?
In this project, I excelled at [e.g., implementing a complex algorithm, problem-solving skills, and efficient code structure]. Additionally, I made sure the application adhered to best coding principles, which include error handling and modularization.

Where could I enhance my code?
While the program functions as intended, I could improve:
- **Performance:** By optimizing certain loops and data structures.
- **Security:** Enhancing input validation and error handling to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
- **Readability:** Adding more inline comments for future reference.

What was the most challenging part, and how did I overcome it?
The most challenging aspect was missing a syntax or having the code do something I wanted it to do something else . I had trouble with while loops at first, but I was able to overcome it by: - Looking for solutions on [Stack Overflow, manuals, course materials].
Debugging with [certain tools like as print statements, GDB, etc.].
Seeking assistance from [internet resources, peers, and professors].

What skills from this project will be transferable?
I was able to improve my **problem-solving** abilities by breaking down difficult jobs into smaller, more manageable parts thanks to this initiative.
**C++ Programming** - Developing my ability to produce well-organized and effective code.
**Debugging** - Acquiring the ability to efficiently troubleshoot issues.
**Version Control** - Project files are managed and modifications are tracked via GitHub.


How did I ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability?
By: **Using modular functions** to divide jobs into smaller, reusable components, I adhered to best coding principles.
To make it easier to read, add comments and documentation.
The code is effectively structured, which facilitates future changes.
**Using meaningful variable names** to improve comprehension and clarity.
